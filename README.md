# WEB102 - Group Lab Repository

Welcome to the **WEB102 Group Lab Repository** for the CodePath course! This repo is intended to be a shared space for all group labs completed throughout the course. Each lab is organized into subdirectories by week, where you can access and download the code for that specific lab.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
/lab-01
  - lab description
  - code files
/lab-02
  - lab description
  - code files
...
```

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific lab assignment. Within each lab folder, you will find:

- **Lab Description:** A brief explanation of the lab objectives.
- **Code Files:** All the code associated with the lab, which you can review and download as needed.
